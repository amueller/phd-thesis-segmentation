\chapter{Introduction}
This thesis investigates the use of structured learning algorithms to the task
of semantic image segmentation. Both topics have recieve much attention in the
computer vision and machine learning communities lately. Unfortunately,
learning structured prediction in computer vision applications is still little
understood.  We hoe this thesis will further the understanding of structured
learning methods, give practical guidance and provide implementations to
further the use of structured prediction methods in computer vision.

The task of semantic segmentation is defined as predicting a semantic class label
for each pixel in a natural image. Predicting semantic labels on such a fine scale
constitutes an important step towards general scene understanding.

Applications of scene understanding include automatic image interpretation for retrieval,
 autonomous driving and mobile robotics.

Current systems for semantic segmentation emply a wealth of different paradigms, most notably:
The ranking of figure ground hypotheses
conditional random field / superpixel? kraehenbuehl?
detector based
sparse coding

We will focus on the use of conditional random fields, which have shown very
promising.  Using the paradigm of structural support vector machines, it is
possible to learn conditional random fields to directly minimize a loss of
interest. In particular, conditional random fields allow to combine different
cues, possibly produced by other approaches, in a principled manner.

We use four different datasets to evaluate our approach: Graz02, Pascal VOC
2010, MSRC-21 and NYU V2.

\section{Thesis Outline}
We start by introducing a novel clustering algorithm in Chapter~\ref{ch:itm},
which is used as a building block in several places for our semantic
segmentation algorithms.  We will then introducing a mostly unstructured
approach to semi-supervised learning for semantic segmentation in
Chaper~\ref{ch:semi_supervised}, investigating the problem of annotating
training data for semantic segmentation.  The central topic of this thesis is
introduced in Chapter~\ref{ch:structured_pystruct}, which also introduces our
software library for implementing structured learning and prediction
algorithms.
Chapter~\ref{ch:comparision} gives a quantitative comparison of the most widely
used structured prediction algorithms, focusing on which algorithm is best to
use in a given situation. In particular, we investigate learning behavior for
semantic segmentation on several datasets.

The problem of learning with approximate inference is investigated in
Chapter~\ref{ch:exact_learning}.  We develop a strategy for efficient caching
and a combination of inference algorithms that allows us to learn SSVMs for
semantic image segmentation exactly, even though the involved factor graphs
contain many loops.

Finally, Chapter~\ref{ch:nyu} applies the methods developed in
Chapter~\ref{ch:structurd_pystruct} and Chapter~\ref{ch:exact_learning} to the
problem of semantic annotation with structure classes in RGB-D data. We
demonstrate that we are able to learn meaningful spacial relations, and improve
upon the state of the art in the NYU V2 datasets that we consider.
