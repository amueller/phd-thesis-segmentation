\chapter{Introduction}

What is semantic segmentation?
Datsets? Input?

Why semantic segmentation? Difference object / stuff centric? -> difference to Alex
Why is it not solved yet?

Structured approaches, latent variable approaches

\section{List of Contributions}
Contributions:
- Introduces general clustering algorithm that improves pipeline in serveral places
- Shows that weakly supervised object class segmentation (not semantic segmentation) is possible
- Provides general efficient framework for structured prediction
- Analyze max-margin learning algorithms in different regimes
- shows exact learning is possible in loopy graphs and improves results (sometimes?)
- shows importance of edge features
- Demonstrates how latent variables benefit semantic segmentation
