Intro
-------
We want to do semantic segmentation. How much annotation do we need? How much structure do we need?
Starting from no annotation, weak annotation, full annotation, modeling more than full annotation (latent variables).


Clustering
-----------
We introduce some shiny new clustering algorithm. It is awesome.
What do we use it for?

MIL
-----
We add additional information for training. How far can we get?
We can't model multiple classes really with bags.

Mil theory
-----------
Without more assumptions, there is little we can say theoretically.

Pystruct
----------
We need more structured models. There are a lot of algorithms and methods.
Let's try them.

Also, look at this beautiful new package.

exact learning
-----------------
Yeah we can do that. Actually not that hard. Pretty sweet :)


latent variables ??
---------------------
There was pottics, but that was not convincing. Now we do it right, right?
Maybe compare symmetric latent variables with semi-supervised?
Subgradient vs CCCP


WEAK POINTS
=============
Clustering
latent variables

Drei moeglichkeiten fuer clustering:
BOW, initalisierung der latenten, unsupervised object segmentation.
Problem bei unsupervised: klassen unterschiedlich gross (MSRC), passt nicht gut zum clustern.
